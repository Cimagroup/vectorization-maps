The Shrec14 persistence diagrams were originally computed by J. Reininghaus, S. Huber, U. Bauer, and R. Kwitt for the paper "A stable multi-scale kernel for topological machine learning". We obtained the data from the github of "A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Methods for Persistence Diagrams" https://github.com/barnesd8/machine_learning_for_persistence/tree/master
