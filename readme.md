## Library

A library containing all the vectorization methods can be found in the [vectorization](https://github.com/Cimagroup/vectorization-maps/tree/master/vectorization) folder. 
To install it, download the repository and, in a terminal inside the repository folder, use:

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `pip install .`

## Experiments

Experiments with three datasets were developed that you can find in the following scripts:
