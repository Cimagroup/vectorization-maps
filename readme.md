# A Survey of Vectorization Methods in Topological Data Analysis

This repository contains the code of the paper ...

## Library

A library containing all the vectorization methods can be found in the [vectorization](https://github.com/Cimagroup/vectorization-maps/tree/master/vectorization) folder. 
To install it, download the repository and in a terminal inside the repository folder use `pip install .`.

## Experiments

Experiments with three datasets were developed that you can find in the following scripts:
